# 🧩 Component Library App (Angular + Node.js)
**Live Site:** [library.fahrnbach.one](https://library.fahrnbach.one)  
**Repo:** [github.com/fahrnbach/angular-library](https://github.com/fahrnbach/angular-library)  

A custom-built Angular + Node.js application showcasing a growing collection of reusable UI components. Designed for speed, scalability, and elegant user experience, this tool is built to serve as both a personal design system and a technical demonstration of frontend performance, component reuse, and backend integration.

## 🧠 Case Study: Building a Full-Stack Component Library

### 🎯 Objective

To design and implement a full-stack web application that demonstrates my ability to architect reusable UI components in Angular while also integrating a backend API using Node.js. The goal was to build a tool I could use to prototype and reuse UI elements in future projects and to display this skillset to prospective employers.

### 🔍 Discovery

In building various projects, I noticed I was often re-creating similar UI elements — cards, tabs, modals, etc. — without a central place to store and test them. I realized that creating a standalone component library would not only improve my workflow but also serve as a strong technical showcase.

### 🛠️ Development

- **Frontend (Angular):**  
  I structured the Angular app using feature modules, isolated component styles, and strict typing. Components are filterable via a live search box, and each includes its own preview + optional documentation panel.  
  Features include:
  - Dark mode toggle (CSS custom properties)
  - Routing to each component demo
  - Local storage for user settings

- **Backend (Node.js + Express):**  
  The backend serves metadata and is designed for future database expansion. Right now, it's a simple Express API with JSON-based mock data, but the app is structured to easily plug in MongoDB or PostgreSQL later.

- **Performance & Design:**  
  Each component is built to be modular and fast. SCSS theming, accessibility best practices, and mobile responsiveness were core priorities.

### 🧪 Challenges Overcome

- Built reusable styles without adding dependencies
- Created a dark mode system that persists across sessions
- Developed a scalable folder and route architecture in Angular

### 🌱 What's Next

- Add code snippets and copy buttons per component
- Connect with a CMS (like my Python blog backend) for live documentation
- Build a favorites system to "star" components
- Add test suites with Jasmine + Karma
